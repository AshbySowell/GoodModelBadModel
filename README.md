## What is gmbm ?
gmbm, short for GoodModelBadModel, is a tool that allows users to compare two machine learning models by visualizing differences, comparing labels via confusion matrices, and highlighting pixel differences. It also features an improvement view where the performance of one model is compared against another based on a ground truth model.
